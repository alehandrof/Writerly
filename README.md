# Writerly -- Sublime Text color schemes for writers

This repository is under heavy development; there is no stable `master` branch currently.

### Wannabe

`Wannabe` is a color scheme for Sublime Text, designed for writers, especially using minimal markup, such as Markdown, but can also be used for some light coding, especially for web stuff (HTML, CSS and the like).

Suggestions and PRs to improve the scheme in these capacities are very welcome. Expanding Wannabe's support for other programming languages will be considered, but is not the main focus.

### History & Credits

`Wannabe` was constructed using @[FictheFolle](https://github.com/FichteFoll)'s wonderful [CSScheme](https://github.com/FichteFoll/CSScheme/). It is based on an earlier theme called simply `Writerly - Light` (earlier versions were called `Typewriter` for various reasons, so this name pops up here and there).

Inspirations (by which I mean blatant theft of code/colors/etc.) for these themes includes:

- Monokai (the structure more than the colors)
- [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized)
- [Brackets](http://brackets.io/)
- [iA Writer](www.iawriter.com)

If you play along, let me know what you think.
